# Description
This is a Altium Script project that contains a Delphi Script for importing testjig data.
It takes a gerber file generated by Macaos, and generates a PcbDoc file with pads for test pins, and a connector for measurements. Net names are imported, and a board outline is defined according to gerber data.

# How to use
Open the TestPinBoardgenerator project in Altiuim Designer
Open the CreateTestjig.pas script
Press F9 (Or menu Run->Run)
If it will not start, check "Run->Select project startup procedure", and select the Run function.

In the file open dialog, select the gerber file from Macaos.

It will generate a new PcbDoc and SchDoc document. Save them to your project directory.

# Customization
There are a few constants at the top of the file that can fine tue hole diameters etc.
There is also a default file name. Setting it to a file path will skip the file-open dialog.

The pin sizes are set to allow 2mm test pin minimum distance with 0.2mm clearance and 0.3mm anualar ring.

# Library
There must be a library for schematics with the following components:
'TP-1MM'    A component with one pin
'M2x32'     A connector with 2x32 pins (total of 64).
