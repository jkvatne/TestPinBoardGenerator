# Description

This is a Altium Script project that contains a Delphi Script for importing testjig data.
It takes a gerber file generated by Macaos, and generates a PcbDoc file with pads for test pins, and a connector for measurements. Net names are imported, and a board outline is defined according to gerber data.

# How to use

Open the TestPinBoardgenerator project in Altiuim Designer
Open the CreateTestjig.pas script

Create a new PCB with your prefered settings and rules.
While this pcb is in focus, go to the menu File | Run Script..
Click on TestPinBoardGenerator -> CreateTestjig -> Run
You will then be queried for the Maccaos mtt file. Select it and click ok.

It will generate a new PcbDoc board. Save itto your project directory.

If a schematic is required, make sure the TestPins.SchLib is open and available.

The select File | Run Script... and select CreateTestjigSchema->Run


# Customization
There are a few constants at the top of the file that can fine tue hole diameters etc.
There is also a default file name. Setting it to a file path will skip the file-open dialog.

The pin sizes are set to allow 2mm test pin minimum distance with 0.2mm clearance and 0.3mm anualar ring.
